* Separated Folders and Subfolders for all of UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE's sprites

--- Features --

- Separated Unused Sprites

- Console Sprites (XBOX Included !!)

- Version Differences

- Sprites from Survey_Program and Ch1&2 Demo (duplicates are merged)

- Separated Sprites With The "_ch1" Suffix

- Un-shuffled tilesets for DELTARUNE

Notes..

Animations marked as USED may still contain unused FRAMES, but most of them are kept together to make importing back into UT/DR easier

Some sprites appear in multiple places but i elected not to duplicate them across folders, so if you can't find one think about the first or most iconic place it was used

Feel free to tell me any errors in my organization or ways it can be improved! This was a pretty big undertaking, so there's bound to be a few oversights
